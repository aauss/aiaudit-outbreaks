<p>Surveillance algorithms usually work on regular spaced aggregated time series of case counts. Let x=(x1,…xT) be such a time series with entries at regularly spaced, discrete timepoints t. An entry xt of that time series is defined as the number of observed case counts in that time period.</p>

<p>Based on this we can view the problem as a sequential supervised learning problem, in which the sequence of counts is paired with a sequence of outbreak labels (x,y), with x=(x1,…,xT),xi∈N0 and yi∈B. For each timepoint t a boolean label is assigned, corresponding to whether there were outbreak cases present in the aggregation time interval. We call this problem time point classification. This is the standard formulation of common surveillance algorithms.</p>

<p>Usually, models fit historic data, assuming that they represent the normal state of the system. Having fitted the data, an estimate for the case counts of the current week is computed. This estimate is compared to the number of cases reported in the current. If the observed case count exceeds the expected number by some threshold, an alarm is raised. Most models in fact compute a predictive distribution for the estimated number of case counts and raise an alarm if the actual number exceeds a certain quantile of this distribution</p>

<p>Can you write a better algorithm?</p>
